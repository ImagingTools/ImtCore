# This directory is for application startup scripts
#
# Startup scripts are run during container startup in alphabetical order.
# They should start your applications and wait for them to be ready.
#
# For Linux:
#   - Create .sh files (e.g., 01-start-myapp.sh)
#   - Make them executable: chmod +x *.sh
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#   - Include health checks to ensure services are ready
#
# For Windows:
#   - Create .ps1 files (e.g., 01-start-myapp.ps1)
#   - Use numbered prefixes to control order (01-, 02-, etc.)
#   - Include health checks to ensure services are ready
#
# Scripts placed here will be run by the entrypoint script.
# Files will be accessible in the Docker container at:
#   Linux: /app/custom-apps/startup/
#   Windows: C:\app\custom-apps\startup\
